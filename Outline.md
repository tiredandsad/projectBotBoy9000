### What should this bot do?

## Role assignment

# - Users can tell the bot what language roles they would like to assign to them by saying 'I'm into Rust' or 'assign me the python role'
# - Users should be able to add pronoun roles. Maybe we do this one as a reaction role 


## Moderation


## Discussion suggestiong


## Currency and rewards?


## Integrate a language model so the bot can answer any question. (this might be something that costs money if not hosted locally)
